After cloning the repo, run npm install in the root folder of the [vue application](https://github.com/erikkvalvik/Assignment5/tree/main/vue-trivia).

**This project is not complete**
The Heroku app is up and running. I am able to create new and log in to existing users and save the users state. The app will redirect to the questions screen if it detects a logged in user. I am able to fetch questions from the opentDB api.
